# omicron-unity CAVE2 Simulator
A example project for developing Unity3D applications for virtual reality environments such as the Electronic Visualization Laboratory's CAVE2(TM). This package and its associated submodule (https://github.com/arthurnishimoto/module-omicron) work as a wrapper around the CAVE2 API so that the CAVE2 environment can be simulated in Unity3D using stock Unity assets (no editor platform dependencies, professional licenses needed).
